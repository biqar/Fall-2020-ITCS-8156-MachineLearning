## W1: Introduction to ML / What is it?
### Objectives:
1. MO1. Getting to know the definition of machine learning
2. MO2. Learning the motivation of machine learning by comparing to traditional programming
3. MO3. Getting ready for the semester (introduction to the basic tools for the class) 

### Resource/Material:
1. Ch1. (Geron or others; choose one)
    * Geron:  Ch 1 (p 3-14, 22-30)
    * Alpaydin: Ch 1

2. Note: Geron's book is the most practice guidance that you can follow. Aplaydin book has a bit more in-depth (but still introductory level) discussion. Murphy book seems to be a bit thorough with detailed mathematical derivations. You can also take a look at Christopher Bishop in the syllabus if you need.
