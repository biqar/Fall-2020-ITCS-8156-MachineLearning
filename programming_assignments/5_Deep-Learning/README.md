# I. Overview

Describe the objective of this assignment. You can briefly state how you accompilsh it.

# II. Data

Introduce your data and visualize them. Describe your observations about the data.
You can reuse the data that you examined in Assignment #0 (of course for classification). 

# III. Methods

In this assignment, you are building a deep network with more than 5 layers using TensorFlow. 
Looking at the chart below, get some idea about how you can construct your networks for what problem and why you pick your structure. 

- Pick at least 3 different networks for experiments.
- Summarize the choice of your networks. 
- Explain your TensorFlow (or Keras) codes. 
- Explain how you apply your model to your data.

# IV - Results

- Presents the results of applications of your deep networks.
- Visualize the results 
- Discuss about the choice of network structures and performance of it as you change the structures.  
- What do you think about the results? 

# Conclusions

Discuss the challenges or somethat that you learned. 
If you have any suggestion about the assignment, you can write about it. 

## Grading

Only well-written notebook will be graded. Please follow the structure and fill in as the other assignments.

--|:--
1 | First structure (implementation, explanation, plot results, discussion of results)
 | Second structure (implementation, explanation, plot results, discussion of results)
 | Third structure (implementation, explanation, plot results, discussion of results)
1 | Explaining and discussing the reason for the selection (Any relation to your data?)
  | Comparing the results, discuss or verify your choice 

#### Optional Extra Credits

- [OPT 1] Test your program with GPUs and compare training speed. You can try [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/) for free 2 hours of GPU resources or MAMBA cluster for this test. 
- [OPT 2] Implement one of neural networks in the chart above and apply it to some real data. 


There are a lot of different neural networks as you see in the figure below. The image is just for your reference but you **are not required** to implement any other types of neurons such as LSTM, CNN, etc. You are fine to use basic neurons with different number of layers and hidden units to fulfil the requirement of this assignment.
